# CQF Ruler Core

This project contains forms the basis of the `cqf-ruler` platform. It extends the `hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter` project. It adds a simple plugin framework that allows new modules to be added at runtime, making it easier to extend. Downstream projects can depend on the `cqf-ruler` Dockerfile and just add their jars.
